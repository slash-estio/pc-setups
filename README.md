# PC Setups

A personal repository, that I use for any new computer I'm using. This is far from a perfect `zshrc`, but the intentions are to build on it as my requirements and skill level improves.

# Requirements

As there is no setup script for this repository - the non-extensive list of requierements are:
* zsh
* oh-my-zsh
* pyenv

# Installation

Run the following from the git repo root.
```bash
ln -l ./zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

# TODO
- [ ] Add setup script or ansible playbook that I could run on `localhost` to install all dependencies.
